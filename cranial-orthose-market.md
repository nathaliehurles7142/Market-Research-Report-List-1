<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market is primarily divided into active and passive helmets, designed to correct skull deformities in infants. Active helmets feature adjustable components that apply adaptive pressure to reshape the skull through controlled growth. In contrast, passive helmets provide a more static approach, offering cushioning and support without active adjustment, relying on natural growth to correct the shape. Both types aim to improve cranial symmetry and aesthetics, enhancing the child's overall development and well-being.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market addresses conditions like plagiocephaly and scaphocephaly, where abnormal head shapes require corrective intervention. Plagiocephaly, characterized by asymmetrical head shapes, often results from sleeping positions, necessitating custom helmets to promote even skull growth. Scaphocephaly, marked by elongated head shapes, arises from early fusion of skull sutures, requiring targeted molding devices for correction. Together with other cranial deformities, these conditions drive demand for specialized orthotic solutions, enhancing treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for affected infants.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquild Non-woven Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Meltblown</li><li>Needle Felt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid non-woven filter market comprises two primary types: meltblown and needle felt filters. Meltblown filters are created by extruding thermoplastic fibers, resulting in a fine, dense mat that excels at capturing small particles, making them ideal for applications requiring high filtration efficiency. Needle felt filters, on the other hand, are made by layering fibers that are then mechanically bonded, providing durability and a higher dirt-holding capacity, suitable for various industrial filtration processes. Both types serve critical roles in liquid filtration.</p></p>
